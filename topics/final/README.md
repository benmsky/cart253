# BUG RACE

## Description

This program displays a random race between three different colored bugs, once the black finish line is reached the program ends. Sabotage the competition by left-mouse clicking on the moving bugs to squish them. I envision this program being used as a random selection game, similar to a dice roll but more fun, place your bets!
