## Description
This program is an interactive arcade-style game inspired by Sabotage, the classic Apple II game from 1981. In this modernized version, you control a turret to defend against falling objects. Use your mouse to aim and click to shoot bullets at the incoming targets. The objective is to achieve the highest score by destroying as many objects as possible. Each destroyed object adds to your score. The game features a vibrant starry and nebula background, dynamic object behaviors, smooth animations, and explosive effects when targets are hit. This updated take on a retro classic combines nostalgic inspiration with fresh visuals and gameplay mechanics for an exciting experience!
