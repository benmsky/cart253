## Description
This program is a simple interactive game where you control a frog with your mouse to catch flies using its tongue. The game has two modes: day and night, which can be toggled with the spacebar. The objective is to catch 20 flies by launching the frogâ€™s tongue with a mouse click. Each fly you catch adds to your score. Once you reach 20 flies, the game ends with a congratulatory message. The game features smooth animations, a dynamic water background, and a glowing effect for the flies at night.
